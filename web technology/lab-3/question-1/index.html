    <h2> CSS LAB </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      CSS is unlike a lot of things in the world of software development. 
      It’s not a programming language, strictly speaking, but it does require abstract thought. 
      It’s not purely a design tool, but it does require some creativity. 
      It provides a deceptively simple declarative syntax, but if you’ve worked with it on any large projects, you know it can grow into unwieldy complexity.

      Love it or hate it, you will use it : the CSS;
