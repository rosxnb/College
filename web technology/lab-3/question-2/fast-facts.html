    <h4> What is a butterfly ðŸ¦‹? </h4>
    <p> A butterfly is a flying insect with a small body and large, often colorful wings. 
      Some gardeners plant specific flowers that attract butterflies. Butterflies are closely 
      related to moths, which also have wings that are large in proportion to their bodies and antennae. </p>
