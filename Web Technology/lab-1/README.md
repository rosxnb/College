## HTML

HTML is a _markup language_ used to turn text document into web-page or web-application. The fundamental
purpose of HTML as markup languge is to __provide semantic description__ (the meaning) of the contents and
__establish document structure__ (the hierarchy of elements).

## HTML5

Unlike previous HTML recommendations, HTML5 _does not_ use Document Type Definition __(DTD)__. Instead it
uses Document Object Model __(DOM)__, a tree data structure formed by the document structure, as its basis
rather than particular set of syntax rules.

Also, unlike previous recommendations, it includes detailed insturctions for how browsers should handle malformed
and legacy markdown.
